# Potent-Portables
A minimal-dependency tool to grab your selected list of portable apps

## What?
Run this on any machine (Mac/Win/Linux) and select the portable apps you want downloaded to your designated location

## Why?
You don't want to install stuff.  You don't want to even open a webpage and have some crazy downloaded "pack".  You just want simple to fill up that pen drive or physical machine you're booting and want to do some things on, quickly.

## Sorry, why this project?  Why Not xx?
This saves time spent searching and collecting.  Most people don't even know what they're looking for on long lists of portable app downloads.
